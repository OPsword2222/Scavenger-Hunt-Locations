# ProfPOI

The intention of this project is to create a full list of the best gather node locations on Wynncraft as well as their coordinates ingame to be used as an Artemis (Wynntils 1.19.4) POIProvider.
After this is largely complete, I will be making a version that can be imported into Legacy (Wynntils 1.12.2)

Each POI will be a group of nodes, and inside the file, a list of the exact node coordinates will be commented in.
## How can you load this ingame?

You would have to do the following command ingame:

/wynntils map poiProvider add "All Gather Locations" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPsword2222/ProfPOI-Rescryan/refs/heads/main/All%20Gathering%20Locations.json"

This can be reloaded with: /wynntils map poiProvider reload

and toggled on/off with: /wynntils map poiProvider toggle All Gather Locations
